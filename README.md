## Ian Perez

Software engineer. Building AI agents that do real work.

I build tools that give AI agents access to the real world — banking, trading, tax optimization, video editing, meeting transcripts, prediction markets, and more. Most of my recent work is in the **Agent Skills Protocol** ecosystem.
